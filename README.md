# nix in docker
Repository for building and pushing docker image with Nix installed on Alpine.

I  created this because the upstream nixos docker image built directly with Nix lacked the required features for running some tools. 
As the development of the upstream image is proceeding, this might become obsolete once all the issues are resolved there.

This repository is adapted from the depreciated [nixos/docker](https://github.com/nixos/docker)
